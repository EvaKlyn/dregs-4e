<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    I'm Eva, a TTRPG enthusiast and I'm running myself through a solo D&D 4e campaign. I play a session, then pick up the pieces
    of what happened to write about here in a sort of prose format.
</p>
<p>
    The world of DREGS isv inspired by <i>Trigun</i>, <i>The Legend of Zelda (NES)</i>, the <i>Like a Dragon</i> series, and <i>Planescape</i>. 
    The Land of Orange Leaves is a Very Meta anachronistic fantasy world in which gunslingers and knights in plate armor can co-exist.

    I'm using Foundry VTT and a gamut of typical 4e tools as well as custom-built procedures and whatnot. Extensive use of the 
    companion character rules found in the DMG II helps me keep combat managable and fast paced for myself.
