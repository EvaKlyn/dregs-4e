**9:00 PM, North QZ, Abandoned house** - Kilo breathed very, very slowly. He had relived the moment in his mind a hundred times, thinking about what could have changed. If he had hit those shots, Korin and Izzie might still be alive. Or if he was up with them in the thick of it. Or if he could have known that those guys were serious business. If he hadn't been so stupid.

Each time, it was as vivid as if it was real. He gazed upon every speck of dust floating in the cool air of the tunnel. He did it again, looking over the tops of his knees at the raiders. 

He was like them, wasn't he? He deserved this from all the times he had pulled the trigger before.

No. It was different when he did it because he was a *good person*. Izzie knew all about being a good person, and she had practically raised him.

He stood up, and walked to where he was ducked behind cover before the battle began. The nine raiders talked amongst themselves, their voices indistinct.

He stepped out of his body, and leapt into action.

Surprise Round

- Kilo shifts forward at incredible speed, tearing into the Leader with his bare hands for 24 damage, nearly killing him outright.

Round 1

- Raiders A, D, F, G, and B all fired shots or took swings at Kilo, but the simply missed. In response, he imagined reaching up through the furthest one's throat and crushing his brain. The Raider H crumpled to the floor in a bloody mess.
- The bandit leader missed a desperate strike with his axe.
- Raider E took a shot, merely grazing Kilo, drawing a little bit of blood from his shoulder.
- Kilo imagined his past self raising the revolver that hurt his arm to fire, and missing as usual. "Useless!" Kilo screamed at who he had been no more than three hours ago.
- Kilo clawed through the Leader again, and his corpse fell to the ground with a wet thud. He turned to Raider A and did the same to him, then danced towards the north side end of the tunnel, his blood-soaked hands ready to go to work on Raider G.

Round 2

- Raiders F, D, G, B and E fired shots at him, and they again simply missed. It denied belief.
- Kilo imagined his past self again, firing a shot at Raider E, catching him in the head through dumb luck.
- Kilo reached out to claw Raider G, but he stepped back too quickly to reach. Kilo yanked the imagined time backwards, this time managing to rip through the Raider, shifting to the next before he even hit the ground.

Round 3

- Raiders D, F, B, and C took shots, and only C's managed to connect. Kilo didn't flinch. A drop of blood dripped from his fingertip, hitting the concrete ground.
- Kilo imagined his past self taking another shot, missing Raider B by a mile. He yanked time backwards, and his past self managed to hit, dropping Raider B.
- Kilo ripped through Raider D, then dashed to raider F, readying himself.
- Raider F slipped through Kilo's defenses and smashed his bad against Kilo's side, causing him to stagger. Kilo's past self leapt from out of cover to get a better shot, but it flew wide. 
- Raider C took a shot which hit Kilo squarely in the shoulder. He shouted in pain, then ripped the baseball bat from Raider F's hands before beating him to death with it. He stepped towards Raider C, who promptly dropped their weapon.

He came to the imaginary man, inspecting his outfit, trying to memorize it. Patches seeming to denote rank? These guys were organized. His razor-sharp fingers cut through the raider's throat, and he dropped to the ground grasping at the wound. Kilo watched him lose strength, eventually falling still.

He turned to face his past self, raising his hand, the air around his fingers glinting like invisible steel.

He felt something prod his back, and he leapt to his feet, his hands shaking, bent into a scratching claw grip.

**9:30 PM**

<p class="dialog">
    OLIVE >> Holy shit, kid, I didn't mean to scare you.
<p>

Kilo noticed his heart was beating incredibly fast, and his breathing was deep and rapid. He lowered his hands, perplexed by what he saw.

It was an elf, here in the quarantine zone. She had a cloth tied over her eyes and top of her head, and a bulletproof vest over a white shirt that was a little too clean for the QZ.

<p class="dialog">
    KILO >> Who...who are you? <br>
    OLIVE >> I'm a doctor from outside the QZ. Or, I was. They don't like me sneaking in here. I'm Olive.
<p>

She put her hand out, and Kilo hesitated.

<p class="dialog">
    OLIVE >> Maybe not right now, eh? <br>
    OLIVE >> Look, I heard you screaming up here, and you look... Unwell, to say the least. <br>
    KILO >> O-oh, sorry. <br>
    OLIVE >> It's not a crime, kid. There was an attack on one of the more peaceful little enclaves around here recently. Do you know anything about that?
<p>

Kilo felt the world fall away from him in pieces like the tiles of a decaying paneled ceiling. Of course, it wasn't just Izzie and Korin. There would be nothing to go back to.

<p class="dialog">
    KILO >> How...bad was it? <br>
    OLIVE >> I dunno. Bad enough to where 4 pickup trucks of those black jacketed fuckers rolled past here armed to the teeth about 3 hours ago. <br>
    KILO >> I live there. Th-those raider guys killed...
<p>

Olive looked down at Kilo, the gears clearly turning in her head.

<p class="dialog">
    OLIVE >> Well, you can't stay here, that's for damn sure. <br>
    KILO >> ...I just kinda want to stay here, in this corner. <br>
    OLIVE >> That ain't happening, kid. C'mon, it's dark enough to where we can just slip away, easy. I've got a little hiding spot not far from here. <br>
    KILO >> I don't think you understand. <br>
    OLIVE >> I think I get it enough to know you are *not* staying here. The last thing this place needs is more unattended traumatized kids. Now, let's go.
<p>

Kilo didn't have the strength to argue.

# Debrief

Session 2, but since there's a session -1, session 1. I rolled an encounter after 3 hours had passed (on a d6), and rolled "criminal friendly" for the NPC, which I interpreted as a doctor risking life, limb, and reputation to go into the QZ to try and help based on other factors I rolled (such as their being an elf).

Since it's probably best to have at least a party of 4, I think Olive may be a "party member," at least for a time.

## Emergence of Subtext

This was really interesting. I honestly picked Battlemind for Kilo's full-fledged class because I like dumb anime hardship-awakens-power trope and psionics are cool, but interpreting it as escapism/dissociation made physically manifest is really interesting, and fitting for a 14 year old (all 14 year-olds are edge lords, universally).

I've also taken the liberty of fluffing equipment as imaginary - his 20(!!) AC is *technically* from scale armor and a heavy shield, but it's fun to imagine that enemies just kind of... miss. It's the sort of thing I'd let a player do if I knew they were going to actually be interesting with it, and I trust myself. Maybe too much.
