title: The QZ
---

The North American Quarantine Zone 4 was constructed quickly in July 2015, three months after the Necrotic Flu was discovered. The Flu is dormant until death, where it resurrects the host body as a mindless zombie which attacks living things. Elves are naturally immune to the virus.

The Zones were constructed, and anyone who was found to be infected was transferred immediately. For the the first 4-5 years things were uncomfortable but okay, but an inflection point came with mandatory barcode tattoos for crossing checkpoints. Slowly, the outside world pulled back from supplying the QZ with adequate support, eventually cutting them off from the world entirely.

Now, in 2024, it's pandemonium. Everyone for themselves, or for their petty warlord leader. *Containment officers* monitor and defend certain functional checkpoints and the exits with extreme prejudice, clad in hazmat combat gear.

## Map Key

**POINT X1** - A nameless enclave in an old semi-suburban neighborhood. Thoroughly pillaged by the Blackjacks. Kilo, Izzie, and Korin are from here.

**POINT A1** - The main Fencer territory. Operating like a classical street gang, they collect "protection fees" from those unlucky enough to reside in their territory. They maintain good relationships with certain Containment officers, sourcing commodities to exchange for necessities.

**PONT A2** - Secondary Fencer turf. Overlaps a bit with the Kill On Sight (KOS) Zone in the central QZ.

**POINT B1** - Primary Blackjacks territory. They have a feudal structure, with Knights and a Court and such. Medieval fascination meets disgruntled construction worker types who have a kind of internal nationalism. 

The main thing that helps them out materially is their structure and militia. Many people who are ruled under their system genuinely support them for the order and ideals they bring, even if they are brutal.

Their long term goal is to get out of the QZ. They think they'll do this by building a strong enough militia and unifying the QZ.

**POINT B2** - Blackjacks FOB1. Basically an armory, they hold their own even in the KOS Zone against Containment officers.

**POINT B3** - Blackjacks FOB2.

**POINT C1** - Main Vineyards territory. The Vineyards provide an important service to the QZ: actually producing food. They're not-so-secretly propped up by Containment, and run like a ruthless business. Psychoactive drugs flow in this territory like water to keep the field workers happy.

**POINT C3 (lol)** - Vineyards FOB. Granted almost unconditional immunity by Containment, this is the center of their distribution network.

**POINTS G1 and 2** - Governmental settlements 1 and 2. Life sucks enough here to drive many people to live elsewhere, even if it's dangerous.
