### Korin (DEAD! Session 1)
![An image of Korin](/assets/img/chara/Korin.jpg)

I never wrote anything up for Korin before the first session, but in my head he was kind of a chaos agent only restrained from indulging in 
apocalyptic chaotic fun by his friends. He was a Black Flame Form Assassin.


### Izzie (DEAD! Session 1)

Izzie is a Half-Orc (Defender Companion); she was a law student before the the outbreak of the Necrotic Flu. Protecting her half-brother, Kilo, serves as her main motivation. Her core thematic belief is that eventually, if they survive 
long enough, there will be a cure and the world will go back to normal.

### Kilo

Kilo is a full human (Striker Companion -> Battlemind). He's only 14 and living in the QZ since he was 5 has profoundly shaped his being. ~~His core thematic belief is that the world is just going to be like this forever, and anything is okay as long as it means he and his friends survive.~~ His core thematic belief is that the world only takes, and it's up to him to claw back as much as he can from anyone who wrongs him.

Notes:
- Is Izzie's half-brother.
- Saw Korin as an older brother and mentor, learning some of his shadow flame techniques over their time together and being influenced by his absurdist outlook.
- Kilo graduated to being a fully fledged PC after the first encounter. Hardship has opened his mind to latent psychic power.

### Olive

Olive is an elf doctor (Striker Companion) who has sacrificed a lot to smuggle themselves in and out of the QZ regularly. She is strongly driven and kind, if blunt and sometimes overly pragmatic. Her core thematic belief is that where harm to innocent people can be reduced, it must be.

Notes:
- Feels like she has to be "the adult" for Kilo, because nobody else seems to want to. She's definitely a little scared of him, too. Magic is rare - and psionics are even more so. Those with psionic powers are usually secreted away as children to be super-soldiers and lab rats.
- Wears a bulletproof vest, wields a sawn-off double-barreled shotgun and takes zero shit from anybody. On the flipside, her status as a doctor willing to look past organizational evil to help individual people grants her passage in most factions' turf.

### Buddy

Buddy is Kilo's dog. Good dog, best friend.
