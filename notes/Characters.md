# Party Members

## Korin (DEAD! Session 1)
![An image of Korin](/assets/img/chara/Korin.jpg)

I never wrote anything up for Korin before the first session, but in my head he was kind of a chaos agent only restrained from indulging in 
apocalyptic chaotic fun by his friends. He was a Black Flame Form Assassin.


## Izzie (DEAD! Session 1)

Izzie is a Half-Orc (Defender Companion); she was a law student before the the outbreak of the Necrotic Flu. Protecting her 
half-brother, Kilo, serves as her main motivation. Her core thematic belief is that eventually, if they survive 
long enough, there will be a cure and the world will go back to normal.

## Kilo

Kilo is a full human (Striker Companion -> Battlemind). He's only 14, living in the QZ since he was 10 has profoundly shaped his being. ~~His core thematic belief is that the world is just going to be like this forever, and anything is okay as long as it means he and his friends survive.~~ His core thematic belief is that the world only takes, and that it's meaningless to fight it.

Notes:
- Was Izzie's half-brother.
- Saw Korin as an older brother and mentor, learning some of his shadow flame techniques over their time together and being influenced by his absurdist outlook.
- Kilo graduated to being a fully fledged PC after the first encounter. Hardship has opened his mind to latent psychic power.

## Buddy

Buddy is Kilo's dog. Good dog, best friend.
