# World Level

**Primary Thematic Problems**: Rebuilding, Disconnection  

Earth was been driven into the ground, and the solution offered by corporations was the Net. The Net was a network of full-dive VR clients that hijacked all input and output from the brain, and was operated jointly by 5 megacorporations.

There are differing theories, but somehow so many minds connected together created The Dreamer, a being that existed for a single millisecond: in that time reshaped the universe into a grand soup of fantasy and mundanity; raising the collective imagination to the throne of physical reality. It took 10 years for the megacorps to claw their way back.

# Schemes

## LOCAL - Subvert the Government

Relevant people:

- **Arya Gill**: lucky, family-oriented but has a drive for profit.
  - Her gang, the **12th November Girls**, deal in smuggling as a way to fund their grand campaign against "Chaos." They are genuinely viewed as protectors in their turf, but are under attack in retaliation for local terrorism. Right now they're aiming to wipe out the provisional government in LoOL.
- **Tommy Day**: natural leader, always looks out for the weak but is prone to outbursts of anger.
  - He's the militia captain of the underground town of Quiet Rivers. Quiet rivers is sizeable, and part of it has been taken over by the Reservoir Society - an issue inherited from the last captain.
- **Griffith Price**: effective deceiver, maintains calm even under extreme pressure but leaves a trail of enemies in his wake.
  - His gang, the **Reservoir Society**, is a militant group that focuses on prostitution and is known for their grand displays of brutality and penchant for chaos. They strike fear into people, acting largely as an incoherent shadowy force the Griffith somehow manages to control. They have skilled and unpredictable lieutenants, bolstered by their acquisition of a sizable botnet.
  - His current goal is to expand into more territory.

Arya Gill, a gang leader in LoOL wants to get her people in the local governance to subvert it inside out. The job is clearly too big for her gang, but it's whatever. Her aim is to oust Tommy Day in such a way that a planted gang member will be promoted in his place.

**01 ->** start of scheme  
**05 ->** ruin rep of small local leader and replace them  
**10 ->** stage false flag attack and blame it on an enemy faction   
**15 ->** attack Reservoir Society and get their own operative promoted as a hero   
**20 ->** get their operative into position for a power grab

# Rival Operators

## Silver Tongues

Blackmailers and bribers. Not usually violent.

- **Daniel Kornelija**: smooth-talker with black market ties who is absorbed in a sex & drugs lifestyle but is currently trying to shake the drugs
- **Tovio Tilman**: a techie with a small army of bots who is using the team to progress a secret goal and is currently trying to be a better family man.
- **Lucina Ascher**: the brawn of the group with a sniper's eye who feels overwhelmed by their lifestyle and is dealing with a tragic romantic relationship. 
- **Slate (Mononym)**: smooth-talker with irrational levels of confidence who is utterly indifferent to the lives of others and has a fixation on debts and favors.

Recently:
- Got an ally killed on a failed job *and* their expenses ate their entire payoff plus some. Their patron sent them into a deathtrap, and now they're pissed.
