# About

I'm Eva, a TTRPG enthusiast and I'm running myself through a solo D&D 4e campaign. I play a session, journaling as I go along interpreting the results of the dice and various solo-play tools. 

The world of *DREGS* is primarily inspired by *Planescape*, *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, a plethora of cyberpunk media, and *Spelljammer*. Too much brain-interfacing VR brought about a magical apocalypse that only took 1 millisecond to reshape the borders between imagination and reality. Turns out the collective unconscious likes the D&D ancestries.

I'm using Foundry VTT to manage sessions and *Mythic GME* to facilitate narrative movement, supplemented with material from *Cities Without Number* and a host of other sources.
