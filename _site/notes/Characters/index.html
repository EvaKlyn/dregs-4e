            <h1>Party Members</h1>
<h2>Korin (DEAD! Session 1)</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/chara/Korin.jpg" alt="An image of Korin"></p>
<p>I never wrote anything up for Korin before the first session, but in my head he was kind of a chaos agent only restrained from indulging in
apocalyptic chaotic fun by his friends. He was a Black Flame Form Assassin.</p>
<h2>Izzie (DEAD! Session 1)</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/chara/Izzie.jpg" alt="An image of Izzie"></p>
<p>Izzie is a Half-Orc (Defender Companion); she was a law student before the the outbreak of the Necrotic Flu. Protecting her
half-brother, Kilo, serves as her main motivation. Her core thematic belief is that eventually, if they survive
long enough, there will be a cure and the world will go back to normal.</p>
<h2>Kilo</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/chara/Kilo.png" alt="An image of Kilo"></p>
<p>Kilo is a full human (Striker Companion -&gt; Battlemind). He's only 14, living in the QZ since he was 10 has profoundly shaped his being. <s>His core thematic belief is that the world is just going to be like this forever, and anything is okay as long as it means he and his friends survive.</s> His core thematic belief is that the world only takes, and that it's meaningless to fight it.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was Izzie's half-brother.</li>
<li>Saw Korin as an older brother and mentor, learning some of his shadow flame techniques over their time together and being influenced by his absurdist outlook.</li>
<li>Kilo graduated to being a fully fledged PC after the first encounter. Hardship has opened his mind to latent psychic power.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Buddy</h2>

<p>Buddy is Kilo's dog. Good dog, best friend.</p>
