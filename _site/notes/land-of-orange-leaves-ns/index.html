<p>The Land of Orange Leaves is a remote world, existing outside the reach of the megacorps, for now. Plant life is orange instead of green here, and the climate is permanently mild due to the influence of the warm oceans surrounding the main landmass.</p>
<p>The population of the world is relatively small and heavily rural, focusing on an idealized pastoral life. To the East there's a large region of sand dunes where almost nobody lives.</p>
<p>There's a provisional government that plans to replace itself with something else, later. That plan has kind of fallen to the wayside with the Carpenter Party taking control.</p>
<p>The Carpenter Party is firmly in opposition to the use of magic and heavily isolationist: they want the Land of Orange Leaves to be a place where life can 'return to normal.' Organized opposition and criminal activity are their #1 enemies, with offenders crucified or burned at the stake.</p>
