            <p><strong>6:10 PM, North QZ</strong> - Korin, Izzie, and Kilo were headed back to camp after an unsuccessful day of scrounging. The community they lived in had a few crops growing, but not enough to feed everyone, necessitating volunteers to go out into the rest of the quarantine zone to scavenge.</p>
<p class="dialog">
    IZZIE >> That new hole in the wall gives a better view of the sunset, don't you think?<br>
    KILO >> Do you think they managed to get out? <br>
    IZZIE >> The area was swarming with containment officers, so I don't think so.
<p>
<p>Izzie's nostrils flared the way they always did when she was thinking about something. Korin glanced over with a smirk, kicking a stone down the road. The sunset was pretty nice, he thought. Days of rain had been good for the food supply, but not so much on the comfort and beauty. A roof that didn't leak horribly was a commodity in the quarantine zone, as was a floor that wasn't covered in moss and grasses.</p>
<p class="dialog">
    KORIN >> I hope whoever it was got out, and I hope they go on to infect the rest of the world. <br>
    IZZIE >> I hope not; that'd slow down the folks working on the cure for sure. <br>
    KILO >> Are they really working on one? <br>
    IZZIE >> Yes. <br>
    KORIN >> No. <br>
<p>
<p>Izzie looked at Korin disapprovingly, to which he gave his best winning smile. Kilo seemed confused.</p>
<p class="dialog">
    KORIN >> Look Izzie, you know my opinions on this whole deal. If this whole thing wasn't intentional from the outset, it sure is now. <br>
    IZZIE >> So cynical. <br>
    KORIN >> How come they haven't like... reverse engineered Elf DNA and made a vaccine by now? <br>
    IZZIE >> I don't think that's how it works-<br>
    KILO >> Guys, shut up for a second, I hear something.
<p>
<p>They stood outside the tunnel back into the neighborhood, listening to the quiet October wind. Echoing from out of the darkness were unfamiliar voices.</p>
<p class="dialog">
    IZZIE >> I'll take the lead. Stay low and quiet. Better safe than sorry.
<p>
<p>With a nod, they hugged the walls and crouched low. The tunnel was partially collapsed, the rubble providing some visual cover. There were 9 unfamiliar men standing at the opposite end of the tunnel, one operating a handheld radio. They idly chatted about the weather and the hole blown in the top of the east wall. Kilo took the binoculars that hung around his neck and focused them on the man who seemed to command the most presence.</p>
<p>He was dressed in black like all of the men, a patch sewn onto his jacket's shoulder displaying a design of 3 concentric hexes: the symbol of a raider gang from the southern QZ. He was palming a large fire axe, his eyes alert.</p>
<p>Kilo made a hand signal to denote danger, the other two nodding. Izzie shoved aside some clutter, revealing a ventilation shaft large enough to climb in. It would come out right where most of the men were standing, but it didn't worry her: she had Orcish blood in her veins. These petty raiders would be dead or captured within a couple minutes.</p>
<p>Korin took the improvised glaive from his back and got behind some low cover, motioning for Kilo to follow closely. It wasn't much more than a machete on a pole, but he was good with it. He snapped his fingers twice, and black sparks flew from them.</p>
<p>The raiders went silent at the sound, and Korin smiled to Kilo, so wide it was almost a grimace. This would be violent. With a whistle to signal to Izzie, Korin catapulted over the concrete barrier.</p>

<li>Korin boosts off of Izzie, almost knocking her over as she moves, using the force to drive his glaive straight through the Leader, vivisecting him in one fell swoop with the force of his shrouds.

<li>Lieutenant B leaps back over the middle cover, shouting about the &quot;the kid in the fucking vents.&quot;</li>

<li>Grunt A breaks free of Izzie's grab, stumbling forward and gasping for air.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>6:25 PM</strong> - Kilo ran, feeling the world fall away beneath his feet. He slipped into an abandoned house, the light of the setting sun casting beams of orange through the shattered windows. He found a secluded corner, drawing his knees up to his chest. This wasn't real, was it?</p>
<p>It couldn't be. He had shot people before, but death was something that happened to other people. Not Izzie. She was strong and tough and wicked smart and she was gonna go to law school just as soon as the quarantine was lifted and and and</p>
<p>It had broken him, like a brick through a window.</p>
<h1>Debrief</h1>
<p>This session went unexpectedly in a fun way. I wasn't expecting to near-TPK session one, but I guess no healing + high damage/minion-heavy encounter was a recipe for that. I'm looking forward to finding out what happens to Kilo, now that his &quot;family&quot; is dead. I'm graduating him up to a full PC rather than just a companion character (DMG II).</p>
<p>Combat was also slowed down by the fact that I was logging it blow-for-blow, and I've bolded highlights for readability. In the future I think I'm only going to log highlights, and possibly write up the battles in prose as well.</p>
