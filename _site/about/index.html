    <h1>About</h1>
<p>
    I'm Eva, a TTRPG enthusiast and I'm running myself through a solo D&D 4e campaign. I play a session, then pick up the pieces
    of what happened to write about here in a sort of prose format.
</p>
<p>
    The world of DREGS is inspired by <i>The Last Of Us</i> and <i>Shadowrun</i>: desperate, contemporary post-apocalypse stuff 
    with fantasy and magical elements. The primary location is a near lawless quarantine zone in a North American city.
    I place an emphasis on explosive violence and interpersonal melodrama, aided by random oracles.
</p>
<p>
    I'm using Foundry VTT and a gamut of typical 4e tools as well as custom-built procedures and whatnot. Extensive use of the 
    companion character rules found in the DMG II helps me keep combat managable and fast paced for myself. The structure of the campaign is 
    inspired by the Yakuza/Like A Dragon series of video games: a small but detailed set of environments in which almost anything can 
    happen, rather than an expansive hexcrawl setting.
